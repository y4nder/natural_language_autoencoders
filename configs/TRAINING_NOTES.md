The Qwen2.5-7B run was the most thoroughly profiled. The engineering lessons
here (FA2 + m16 without gradient checkpointing, the response-length cap, the
`list→np.asarray` GC fix) carry over to the other three models. We did **not**
re-sweep LR / batch size per model — the shipped `configs/*.sh` are the Qwen
settings with only light adjustment, so there is likely headroom from a
per-model tune.

Measured on 2× H100-80GB. Data: 100k UltraFineWeb documents × 5 vectors =
500k pairs, split evenly between AV and AR SFT.

## Actor SFT (full 28-layer model)

```bash
--actor-num-gpus-per-node 2
--rollout-batch-size 256 --global-batch-size 256
--micro-batch-size 16           # grad_accum=8; m32+ OOMs without grad ckpt
--num-rollout 1000              # ≈1 epoch on 250k rows
--lr 2e-5 --min-lr 2e-6         # see LR scan — 5e-5 converges faster on TRAIN loss but
                                #   real-vs-rand gap (~0.21) is the signal, not train loss.
                                #   Sticking with 2e-5 where the gap is verified stable.
--lr-warmup-iters 50            # 5% of num-rollout
--lr-decay-style cosine
--attn-implementation flash_attention_2
                                # NO --gradient-checkpointing — m16 fits without it, 36% faster
--save-interval 500             # checkpoint at halfway + final
--nla-injection-scale 150
--loss-mask-type qwen           # masks out prompt, loss only on response tokens
```

**Step time**: **4.97s** with all fixes (was 14.19s — **2.85× faster**). ~44% MFU. 94% GPU util (wait ~6%).
**Peak memory**: 67-80GB / 82GB (post-clear drops to ~33GB).
**Loss trajectory**: 4.4 (step 0) → 2.9 (warmup end) → 1.5 (step 300) → still dropping.
**vs random baseline** (shuffled activation vectors): ~0.2 lower loss by step 300 — real signal being learned.

## Critic SL (20-layer truncated model)

```bash
--actor-num-gpus-per-node 2
--rollout-batch-size 256 --global-batch-size 256
--micro-batch-size 64
--num-rollout 1000
--lr 2e-5 --min-lr 2e-6         # matched to actor — worked well
--lr-warmup-iters 50
--lr-decay-style cosine
--attn-implementation sdpa
                                # NO gradient checkpointing needed (fits at ~67GB)
--save-interval 500
```

**Step time**: ~3s. ~31% MFU.
**Peak memory**: ~67GB / 82GB.
**Loss trajectory**: 1.61 (step 0, identity init) → 1.08 (step 23) → 0.72 (step 380) → **0.586** final.
**Predict-the-mean baselines** — there are two, and which one you divide by matters
(see "Computing FVE" in docs/inference.md):

- **raw-mean (canonical)**: MSE(v̂, μ) ≈ 0.72, the variance of the normalized golds around
  their *un-normalized* mean. This is the classical FVE denominator — `train/fve` and all
  released `fve_nrm` numbers use it. **Do not normalize μ.**
- **normalized-mean**: MSE(v̂, normalize(μ)) = 0.938, the critic's best achievable loss with
  a constant prediction (its output also gets normalized). Useful as a "is it learning at
  all?" gate — critic_rand (shuffled targets) got 0.922 ≈ this, as expected — but it
  inflates FVE if used as the denominator.

Both computed automatically at startup (`nla.schema.compute_predict_mean_baselines`);
`fve_nrm` is logged per-step against the raw-mean baseline (`nla_baseline_rawvar`).

### ⚠️ Critical: identity-init `value_head`

`prepare_critic_checkpoint` must set `value_head.weight = torch.eye(d)`. PyTorch's default
`nn.Linear` init (kaiming_uniform) scales the backbone's output norm by ~1/√3, making step-0
`pred_norm ≈ 48` when `backbone_norm ≈ 83`. With identity init, `pred_norm ≈ backbone_norm` at
step 0 and initial loss drops from 1.94 → 1.61 (~17% better starting direction match).

## Memory notes — why actor needs grad checkpointing

Actor OOMs without grad ckpt at **any** micro_bsz ≥ 32. Confirmed failures:
- SDPA no-ckpt m64: 74.9GB OOM (forward)
- SDPA no-ckpt m32: 73.3GB OOM (backward — FSDP param gather + activations)
- FA2 no-ckpt m64/48/32: all OOM (FA2's O(T²) score-matrix saving is ~3MB at seq=247; negligible vs ~35GB MLP intermediates)
- FA2+ckpt m128: OOM (even with ckpt, m128 activations don't fit)

**Why actor ≠ critic** (both at m64, only actor needs ckpt):
| | actor | critic |
|---|---|---|
| seq length | 247 (prompt 125 + resp 122) | 126 |
| layers | 28 | 20 |
| output head | lm_head (d×vocab = 545M params, 4.8GB logits) | value_head (d×d = 13M params) |

All three factors compound. The lm_head forward alone is ~17 TFLOPs — equivalent to ~7
transformer layers worth of linear ops.

## Config sweep results — use **flash_attention_2 + NO grad ckpt + micro=16**

| config | step_time | grad_accum | vs baseline |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FA2 + no-ckpt + m16** | **9.05s** | 8 | **← best — 36% faster** |
| FA2 + ckpt + m64 | 12.83s | 2 | −10% |
| sdpa + ckpt + m64 | 14.19s | 2 | baseline |
| FA2 no-ckpt m64/48/32 | OOM | — | activations too large |
| FA2 + ckpt + m96/128/160 | OOM | — | peak ~67GB at m64 is already ceiling |
| sdpa no-ckpt m24 | 479s (!) | 5.33 (!) | non-integer grad_accum → pathological |

**Why m16 wins**: FLOP-equivalence — 8 microbatches × (fwd+bwd) = 2 microbatches × (fwd+recompute+bwd).
The extra FSDP gather/scatter overhead (6 more rounds ≈ ~1s on NVLink) is less than the saved
recompute cost (~4s). Memory: m16 activations fit where m32 OOMed at 73GB.

**Recommended**: `--attn-implementation flash_attention_2 --micro-batch-size 16` (NO `--gradient-checkpointing`).

### Critical data pipeline fix — `list` → `np.asarray` in NLADataSource

`data_source.py` previously stored `activation_vector` as `list(row[...])` — 250k rows × 3584
floats = **896M list slots** in the RolloutManager heap. Python's cyclic GC scans ALL slots
every gen2 collection (triggered by tokenizer allocation churn) → **2.6s stall per GC fire**,
~1.4 fires per rollout → 3.6s of the 4.2s `train_wait_time`.

Fix: `np.asarray(dtype=float32)`. Numpy arrays are GC-atomic. `torch.tensor`
consumers unchanged. **Measured step_time 9.5s → 8.3s** (isolated benchmark predicted ~6s but
real training has more heap). Also: dataset init 2× faster, RSS −4GB. Remaining ~3.3s train_wait
is Ray serialize + convert_samples_to_train_data — next target.

## LR scan (60 steps, warmup=10)

| LR | step-60 loss |
|---|---|
| 2e-5 | 1.857 |
| **5e-5** | **1.680** ← best |
| 1e-4 | 1.704 |
| 2e-4 | 1.718 |

**200-step confirmation**: lr=5e-5 late → loss **1.510**, matching lr=2e-5 @ step **500**.
**2.5× speedup** in steps-to-same-loss on *train loss alone*.

**But train loss isn't the target — real-vs-rand gap is.** The main 1000-step run at lr=2e-5
shows a stable ~0.21 gap (real 1.50 vs rand 1.71). We haven't verified 5e-5 preserves this gap
(scan only ran real). **Sticking with 2e-5** where the gap is known good. Revisit if RL needs
faster critic retraining per rollout.

### LR scaling when changing batch size

Reference: **lr=2e-5 at batch=256** (our production setting). Scale LR by √(batch/256):

| batch | recommended LR |
|---|---|
| 128 | 1.4e-5 |
| 256 | 2e-5 (reference) |
| 512 | 2.8e-5 |
| 1024 | 4e-5 |

This is the sqrt rule for Adam-family optimizers. `configs/actor_sft.sh` prints a warning at launch if
your LR is >2× off the sqrt-scaled recommendation.

## RL config — the settings we used (see caveat at top)

```bash
--lr 1e-5 --critic-lr 5e-5           # LR scan winner (9 combos, 30 steps each)
--rollout-max-response-len 150       # stops length drift at the source. At high LR the critic
                                     #   rewards verbosity → resp_len drifts 123→165+ otherwise.
                                     #   With cap=150, m16 works fine (seq~275, no OOM).
--micro-batch-size 16                # m16 is fine with resp_len capped at 150
--rollout-batch-size 64 --n-samples-per-prompt 8  # 512 gens/rollout, GRPO over 8
--attn-implementation flash_attention_2
# NO --gradient-checkpointing — causes NCCL deadlock in update_weights()
#   (FSDP full-param gather behaves differently, broadcast hangs, 10min watchdog SIGABRT)
```

**LR scan results** (30 steps each, fve_nrm @ final step):
| actor_lr | critic_lr | fve_nrm | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5e-7 | 5e-7 | 0.175 | too slow |
| 1e-6 | 1e-6 | 0.188 | |
| 2e-6 | 2e-6 | 0.212 | |
| 5e-6 | 5e-6 | 0.295 | |
| 1e-5 | 1e-5 | 0.377 | phase1 winner |
| 1e-5 | 2e-5 | 0.429 | |
| **1e-5** | **5e-5** | **0.483** | **← winner** |
| 1e-5 | 1e-4 | 0.453@s26 | OOM (resp_len=187), trend reversed |
| *1e-6* | *2e-5* | *0.265* | *original baseline (mismatched)* |

(This Qwen-only scan informed our choice; we did not systematically sweep across models.)

**Lesson**: actor LR was the original bottleneck — raising it 10× from the mismatched
baseline is what mattered. Read the scan's apparent win for higher critic LRs with
suspicion: a 30-step horizon unduly advantages a fast-learning critic (quick FVE gains
that don't necessarily hold up over a full run), and a hotter critic also rewards
verbosity → actor learns length → OOM risk. In practice we ran actor and critic LR at
parity for most of training.

## Production run — the released Qwen2.5-7B checkpoints

The released [`kitft/nla-qwen2.5-7b-L20-av`](https://huggingface.co/kitft/nla-qwen2.5-7b-L20-av) /
[`-ar`](https://huggingface.co/kitft/nla-qwen2.5-7b-L20-ar) pair came from a 2×8×H100 run — the
LR-scan winner above scaled up by the √(batch) rule (×√2 for 512 → 1024):

| | LR-scan config (above) | production run (released) |
|---|---|---|
| prompts/rollout | 64 | 128 |
| samples/prompt (GRPO group) | 8 | 8 |
| global batch (samples) | 512 | 1024 |
| actor (AV) lr | 1e-5 | 1.41e-5 (= 1e-5 × √2) |
| critic (AR) lr | 5e-5 | 1.41e-5 (parity with actor)† |
| KL loss (`--use-kl-loss --kl-loss-coef`) | — | 0.01 |
| response cap | 150 tok (truncated → reward −2) | same |
| saved at | — | `rollout_id: 4199` (sidecar) |
| final fve_nrm | — | 0.752 |

† For most of training. The released AR sidecar records `lr: 7.07e-5` at save time
(the √2-scaled scan winner); we regard the scan's preference for higher critic LRs as
a short-horizon artifact (see Lesson above) and ran at parity. The `training:` block
in each released checkpoint's `nla_meta.yaml` records what was in effect at save time.

`configs/rl.sh` defaults now ship this configuration: parity LRs at **1.41e-5**,
1024-sample global batch, KL loss coef **0.01**.

**Reading the paper appendix against this table**: the paper's "batch size of 128" is
prompts per step (× G=8 samples = the 1024-sample global batch here), and its
"learning rate of 10⁻⁵" is the parity LR rounded from 1.41e-5; the KL coefficient is
the value above.

### All four released model families

The other three families reused the Qwen recipe with light per-model adjustment
(no per-model sweep). The standard setup throughout was **128 prompts × G=8 =
1024 samples per rollout** (the paper's "batch size of 128" is prompts; multiply
by the group size). The 150-token response cap applies everywhere; LRs ran at
actor/critic parity.

| | backend | RL lr (AV = AR) | sidecar `global_batch_size`‡ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5-7B (L20) | FSDP | 1.41e-5† | 1024 |
| Gemma-3-12B (L32) | FSDP | 1e-5 | 1024 |
| Gemma-3-27B (L41) | FSDP | 1.41e-5 | 2048 |
| Llama-3.3-70B (L53) | Megatron | 5e-6 | 4096 |

† see footnote above re: the Qwen AR sidecar recording 7.07e-5 at save time.

‡ The raw `--global-batch-size` arg recorded at save time. For Qwen/12B this
equals the actual 1024 samples per rollout, and the 27B run may genuinely have
used 2048 (256 prompts × 8). The 70B entry is the doubtful one: the run did not
use 4096-sample (512-prompt) steps — the recorded arg does not necessarily
equal samples per optimizer step.

**Tuning headroom**: throughput knobs (micro-batch size, attention implementation,
dynamic batching) were not profiled carefully and are not optimised for any particular
hardware — not even the H100s we ran on. Worth tuning for your setup; they affect step
time, not the training math.

**Keep training on-policy**: `configs/rl.sh` uses Miles' synchronous `train.py` —
generate → train → sync weights to SGLang, every step, with each rollout consumed in
exactly one optimizer step (128 × 8 = 1024 = global batch). **This is the only
configuration we have tested**; all released checkpoints were trained this way. Two
specific cautions:

- **One step per rollout**: `NLAFSDPActor` refuses to start when
  `rollout_batch_size × n_samples_per_prompt != global_batch_size`; set
  `NLA_I_KNOW_WHAT_IM_DOING=1` to bypass. The mismatch wouldn't actually change the
  step count (the FSDP path forces one step per rollout) — but the loss normalizer
  divides by `global_batch_size`, so it silently rescales gradients instead.
- **No overlapped generation/training**: with Miles' `train_async.py`, rollout N+1 is
  generated while rollout N trains, so samples come from slightly stale weights. In
  our experience this train/sample mismatch can hurt training, but we have not
  investigated it carefully. Stick with `train.py` unless you know what you're doing.

## RL infrastructure notes

- `--sglang-disable-radix-cache` — required for input_embeds path
- `del payload["input_ids"]` in `nla_generate.py` — SGLang confused by both ids+embeds. Symptom: k3 (the GRPO importance-ratio diagnostic) floored at ≈0.20; after fix k3≈0.001.
- `--group-rm` for batched critic reward computation (critic_fwd via Ray remote, reward off rollout GPU)
- Step time ~47s with rollout_batch=64×8 (90% is SGLang rollout wait — actor train is 10-20s)
- **`export NLA_EMBED_DUMP_DIR=/dev/shm/nla`** — the per-step 1.1GB embedding dump for
  nla_generate was going to `/tmp` (overlay fs = disk, ~1.5s/step). /dev/shm is tmpfs (RAM).
  Zero code change — `embed_dump_path` already checks this env var.
