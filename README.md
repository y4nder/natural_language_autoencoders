A Natural Language Autoencoder is a pair of fine-tuned LMs that map
residual-stream activation vectors to natural language and back:

| | direction | mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **AV** (activation verbalizer) | `vector → text` | inject the vector as a single token embedding into a fixed prompt, autoregress a description |
| **AR** (activation reconstructor) | `text → vector` | truncated K+1-layer LM + `Linear(d, d)` head, extract at the final token |

Both vectors are L2-normalised before comparison, so the round-trip
`MSE(reconstructed, original) = 2(1 − cos)` measures direction agreement only.
Low MSE means the AR could recover the original direction from the AV's words
alone, which implies the explanation captures the information in the vector.

This is the **full training repo** — data generation, SFT, GRPO RL, and
checkpoint conversion. For a lightweight inference-only package (just
`NLAClient` + `NLACritic`, no training deps), see
[`kitft/nla-inference`](https://github.com/kitft/nla-inference).

> **A note on naming.** Public-facing names are **AV** / **AR**. Inside the
> `nla/` package you will see **actor** / **critic** — those are the same two
> models, named to map directly onto Miles' RL primitives (the AV *is* the
> policy actor; the AR *is* the value critic). The codebase keeps actor/critic
> so the Miles extension points read naturally; everywhere user-facing we use
> AV/AR.

## Released checkpoints

All eight checkpoints are gathered in the
**[`kitft/nla-models` collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/kitft/nla-models)**
on the HF Hub — four base-model families, each with an AV and an AR. We extract
from a layer roughly **two-thirds of the way through the model** in each case
— deep enough that the residual stream carries rich semantic content, shallow
enough that it hasn't yet collapsed toward the unembedding.

| base model | layer | d_model | AV | AR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct | 20 / 28 | 3584 | [`kitft/nla-qwen2.5-7b-L20-av`](https://huggingface.co/kitft/nla-qwen2.5-7b-L20-av) | [`kitft/nla-qwen2.5-7b-L20-ar`](https://huggingface.co/kitft/nla-qwen2.5-7b-L20-ar) |
| Gemma-3-12B-IT | 32 / 48 | 3840 | [`kitft/nla-gemma3-12b-L32-av`](https://huggingface.co/kitft/nla-gemma3-12b-L32-av) | [`kitft/nla-gemma3-12b-L32-ar`](https://huggingface.co/kitft/nla-gemma3-12b-L32-ar) |
| Gemma-3-27B-IT | 41 / 62 | 5376 | [`kitft/nla-gemma3-27b-L41-av`](https://huggingface.co/kitft/nla-gemma3-27b-L41-av) | [`kitft/nla-gemma3-27b-L41-ar`](https://huggingface.co/kitft/nla-gemma3-27b-L41-ar) |
| Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct | 53 / 80 | 8192 | [`kitft/Llama-3.3-70B-NLA-L53-av`](https://huggingface.co/kitft/Llama-3.3-70B-NLA-L53-av) | [`kitft/Llama-3.3-70B-NLA-L53-ar`](https://huggingface.co/kitft/Llama-3.3-70B-NLA-L53-ar) |

Each checkpoint ships an `nla_meta.yaml` sidecar with the prompt template,
injection token IDs, and scale factors that the model was trained with — load
those, never hardcode them.

## How it fits together

NLA training is built as a thin extension on top of two open-source projects:

- **[Miles](https://github.com/radixark/miles)** — Ray-orchestrated RL training
  (FSDP2 / Megatron backends, GRPO, async rollout). We used the FSDP backend
  for the 7B/12B/27B runs and Megatron only for Llama-70B. NLA plugs in via Miles'
  upstream `--custom-rm-path`, `--data-source-path`, and
  `--custom-generate-function-path` extension points; the integration patch in
  `nla/miles_patches/` adds `--custom-actor-cls-path` and `--force-use-critic`
  on top (see [docs/design.md §2](docs/design.md)).
- **[SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang)** — rollout serving. We
  send `input_embeds` (not `input_ids`) so the AV sees the injected vector;
  SGLang serves it like any other request. The embed sequence is built on the
  **trainer side** — we look up the prompt tokens in the actor's own embedding
  table, splice the activation vector in at the injection slot, and ship the
  finished `[seq, d]` tensor over HTTP. SGLang never needs to know what an
  injection is. We don't apply any learned map to the injected vector in this
  work — it goes in raw (after a fixed scalar `injection_scale`) — but this
  design means a future affine `W·v + b` adapter would be a trainer-side-only
  change: apply it before sending, no SGLang modification required. (vLLM also
  supports `input_embeds` and would work as a drop-in alternative.)

We chose this stack because it is **near-frontier training infrastructure**:
Miles + Megatron is what production-scale RL post-training looks like, and
hooking onto it cleanly is what let us scale to RL-ing a 70B-parameter AV — and
likely further. The `nla/` package never modifies Miles or SGLang in place; it
only subclasses and registers function-pointer hooks, so upstream updates pull
in cleanly.

## Quick start

### Inference (use a released checkpoint)

```bash
uv pip install torch transformers safetensors httpx orjson pyyaml numpy
uv pip install "sglang[all]>=0.5.6"

python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path kitft/nla-qwen2.5-7b-L20-av \
    --port 30000 --disable-radix-cache &

python nla_inference.py kitft/nla-qwen2.5-7b-L20-av \
    --sglang-url http://localhost:30000 \
    --parquet path/to/activations.parquet
```

Don't have a parquet yet? Any file with an `activation_vector` column of
`d_model`-wide float lists will do — here's a minimal one for Qwen layer 20:

```python
import torch, pyarrow as pa, pyarrow.parquet as pq
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
tok = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct")
m = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct",
        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="cuda")
ids = tok("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
hs = m(**ids, output_hidden_states=True).hidden_states[20][0]  # [seq, 3584]
pq.write_table(pa.table({"activation_vector": hs.float().cpu().tolist()}), "demo.parquet")
```

(Or omit `--parquet` entirely for a smoke test on a random unit vector.)

`nla_inference.py` is a single self-contained file. The full recipe —
model-specific scale factors, the Gemma `√d` embed-scale gotcha, debugging the
"output is in Chinese" failure mode, AR scoring — is in
**[docs/inference.md](docs/inference.md)**. Worked transcripts in
[`examples/`](examples/).

### Training (reproduce a checkpoint)

Install Miles + SGLang + this package per **[docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md)**,
then run the three stages (Qwen7B reference: SFT on 2×H100-80GB; RL to ~75% FVE
on 2×8×H100 — see [`configs/TRAINING_NOTES.md`](configs/TRAINING_NOTES.md)):

```bash
# 0. Generate data (GPU + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
python -m nla.datagen.run_pipeline --config configs/datagen/qwen7b_fineweb_1M.yaml

# 1. AR SFT (MSE on raw activations)
bash configs/critic_sft.sh

# 2. AV SFT (next-token on API-generated explanations, with injection)
bash configs/actor_sft.sh

# 3. RL: simultaneous AV (GRPO) + AR (supervised); reward = -mse_nrm
bash configs/rl.sh
```

The full design — data transport through Miles' `multimodal_train_inputs`, the
injection forward-hook, simultaneous AV/AR scheduling, why `cp_size==1` — is in
**[docs/design.md](docs/design.md)**. Detailed profiling and hyperparameter
notes (Qwen7B case study; we reused those settings with only light adjustment
for the other models — a per-model sweep would likely do better):
[`configs/TRAINING_NOTES.md`](configs/TRAINING_NOTES.md).
